<title>GWT Validation - Architecture</title>

<body>

	<h2>Architecture</h2>

	<p>From an architectural view we can divide the library into two
		parts: client side and server side validation.</p>
	<h2>Client side validation architecture</h2>
	<p>
		On the client side we foremost have the usability aspect of
		validation. The users who will mostly be not malicious (hopefully)
		need a way of knowing that they entered some data that the application
		can tell is not correct. The requirements of the application might
		also require, that the validations should be shown in a "nice" and/or
		contextual way to the end user. So here is where probably the most
		work is needed from the developers point of view (even though its
		useless from a security point of view). <br />In order to support
		this kind of usage the client side part of the library has the
		following functionality:
	<ul>
		<li>Validate input fields</li>
		<li>Show "nice" error messages</li>
		<li>Show validation errors coming from the server side</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>There are three main objects that you will use while doing
		validation with the GWT Validation Library.
	<ul>
		<li>Validators</li>
		<p>The validators are used to implement a validation constraint.
			These validators can be instantiated with widgets which act as an
			input for the validators validation algorithm. For example you can
			use an IntegerValidator and add a TextBox instance to it. It will
			then validate that the value entered into the TextBox instance is an
			integer value. The only thing that validators do is to inform your
			application that one or more values failed to meet the required
			validation constraints (what you do with this information is
			completely up to you).</p>
		<li>Actions</li>
		<p>The actions define a specific functionality that should be
			carried out when a specific validator fails. An action or even
			multiple actions can be added to a validator, so you have the freedom
			of reacting differently for different validation constraints or
			widgets, additionally you are able to build your actions as you
			require them once and reuse them everywhere. An example action would
			be the StyleAction, which will add and, optionally, remove a
			CSS-style from the validated widget if the validation failed (E.g.
			adding a style that adds a red border to the widget which failed
			input validation).</p>
		<li>Transformers</li>
		<p>Transformers also fall into the category "usability". They
			might be used to assist the user in the data entry process. For
			example there is an UpperCaseTransformer. It is used to transform the
			data entered into some TextBox into upper case. So the user is
			assisted by this functionality in his data entry process.</p>
	</ul>
	</p>




	<p>While the library already comes with some validators, actions
		and transformers it is easy for you to create your own. So you have
		the freedom of implementing the validation cases you really need and
		are not provided for by the library (this is what makes this library
		also a validation framework).</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		One core element of the actual validation process was left out so far.
		The
		<tt>ValidationProcessor</tt>
		. It is responsible for invoking all the necessary validations and
		invoking the actions for all the failed validations. It is also
		responsible for handling errors that occured on the server side of the
		application (more on that later). For each window, dialog, etc. there
		is usually one instance that you invoke to validate all the fields.
		The result will tell you whether client side validation failed or
		succeeded. If it failed all the actions added to validators that
		failed will be invoked automatically. If it succeeded you propably
		want to communicate the entered data to the server (You don't have to,
		the library doesn't bother with how you communicate your data to the
		server).
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>Look at the schematic drawing below. It shows you how the
		components (your input fields and GWT-VL) interact with each other on
		the client side.</p>

	<h2>Server side validation architecture</h2>
	<p>The server side validation does not care about things like
		usability or how the validation errors are presented to the user. Its
		purpose is to ensure syntactically and semantically correct user
		input. This can only be achieved at the server side, as we can never
		trust the data that gets sent from the client side. That means that on
		the server side we need to be aware that possibly every single data
		input may be wrong or even malicious, so we need to check each and
		every input. Furthermore some validations can only be carried out on
		the server side. As a result the server side part of the library has
		the following functionality:
	<ul>
		<li>Validate user input</li>
		<li>Hand over possible validation errors to the client</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>As you can see the server side has nothing to do with how or
		even if that information is presented to the end user.</p>
	<p>
		As a result the server side is not quite so complex as the client side
		part of the library. The main part you will use will be the
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		class. It provides methods such as
		<tt>ServerValidation.notNull</tt>
		etc. that will help you to check correct data on the server side and
		already gives you the functionality for talking back validation errors
		to the client which will then be visually rich (as you defined them)
		shown to the end user. The good thing is, that you are not limited to
		the
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		class validation functionality. You can easily do your own possibly
		more advanced checks (like checking if some property value already
		exists in the database, eg. a username). The
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		class gives you an really easy way to talk even these back to the
		client with (
		<tt>ServerValidation.exception()</tt>
		!) and you still profit from the automatic action invocation on the
		client side.
	</p>
	<p>If you are using Hibernate-Validator you can even use some of
		the hibernate validation constraints. If they fail it will also be
		talked back to the client automatically without you needing to plugin
		some custom code everywhere to get the profit from the hibernate
		validations. Actually you can use all of the Hibernate-Validator
		annotations. Although there are some issues with some of the
		validation constraints that prevent the GWT Validation Library from
		knowing which of the properties caused the failure. Right now there is
		nothing that the library can do, the problem occurs only with
		annotations that need to query the database in order to know if the
		validation failed or not (e.g. unique=true on a column). So you should
		take care of these cases yourself (which is not so complicated after
		all). Annotations like @NotNull or @Length are automatically taken
		care of by GWT-VL. In the future their might be additions to that
		behaviour, so stay tuned.</p>

	<p>For connecting the client side with the server side validation
		there exist two possible ways.
	<ul>
		<li>GWT-RPC</li>
		<p>If you can use RPC, than all the methods of the services that
			do validation and want to talk the validation information back to the
			client, are required declaring to throw ValidationException's. After
			an failed async call this exception can be passed to the
			ValidationProcessor who will parse it and invoke the failed
			validation actions according to the exception.</p>
		<li>Generic plain text</li>
		<p>If you are not using GWT-RPC there is the possibility to use a
			functionality provided by GWT-VL that can translate a
			ValidationException into a simple String representation. This can
			then be send to the client and the ValidationProcessor is able to
			reconstruct the ValidationException from this String.</p>
	</ul>
	<p>To the user it should be fairly transparent whether the
		validation error was rooted on a client side validation or on a server
		side validation. The only "feelable" difference might be a short delay
		in response time depending on how fast the client-server communication
		is.</p>
	<p>The schematic drawing below shows you how the server side part
		of the library is architectured:</p>
