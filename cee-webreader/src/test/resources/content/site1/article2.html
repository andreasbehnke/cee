	<h2>Client side validation</h2>

	<p>To get you up and running I will you show you a quick example
		how the client side of the validation functionality is build using the
		GWT Validation Library.</p>
	<p>We will have a form with one TextBox widget which will be used
		for entering the year of birth. If the validation fails we want the
		TextBox to get a red border, additionally a label should be set to the
		corresponding error message, that tells the user what went wrong.
		Standard GWT stuff will be for some part ignored because the example
		should help you focus on the specifics of validation (Its assumed that
		you know standard GWT stuff).</p>
	<p>So let's start:</p>
	<p>
		We have a Dialog which we added the TextBox to. What we need
		additionally is a button that will trigger the validation and a Label
		that will present the validation error message, if there was one. <br />
		So we basically have something like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
	TextBox birthYearTextBox = new TextBox();
	Label errorLabel = new Label("");
	Button validateButton = new Button("Validate!");
			</pre>
	<br />
	<p>We would add these components to the dialog and then we would
		setup the validation constraints like this:</p>
	<pre>
	ValidationProcessor validator = new DefaultValidationProcessor();
	
	validator.addValidators( "birthYear",
		new IntegerValidator(birthYearTextBox, 1890, 2009)
			.addActionForFailure(new StyleAction("validationFailedBorder"))
			.addActionForFailure(new LabelTextAction(errorLabel))
	);
			</pre>
	<p>
		We now have associated a validation constraint with a widget. We
		configured the <i>IntegerValidator</i> so that it will accept integer
		values in the range of [1890,2009]. We added two actions to the
		validator. The first action is the <i>StyleAction</i> which we
		configured to add the "validationFailedBorder" CSS-style (These styles
		must be defined by you in your projects CSS-file) to the validated
		widget (the TextBox), if it fails the validation. The second action
		that will be invoked if the validation fails is the <i>LabelTextAction</i>.
		It will set the text of the label to the error message that the <i>IntegerValidator</i>
		generates if its constraint is violated.
	</p>
	<p>The only thing missing now, is the invocation of the validation
		process. Normally, before the data is send to the server we will
		perform client side validation and abort if it finds errors. To do
		this we configure the validate button to trigger validation:</p>
	<pre>
	validateButton.addClickListener(new ClickListener() {
		public void onClick(Widget sender) {
			boolean success = validator.validate();
			if(success) {
				//No validation errors found. We can submit the data to the server!
			}else {
				//One (or more) validations failed. The actions will have been
				//already invoked by the validator.validate() call.
			}
		}
	});
			</pre>
	<p>
		That is essentially all you have to do to add rich client validations.
		You would do this with every data input widget that you want to
		validate. There is also the concept of
		<tt>GroupValidator</tt>
		's that are able to group certain validators and can then be used as a
		single validator. For example there exists a
		<tt>TrimmedStringLengthValidator</tt>
		. It consists of a TrimTransformator that will trim the input of a
		widget and a
		<tt>StringLengthValidator</tt>
		that will check if the trimmed input has a specific length.<br /> <br />As
		with validators, transformators and actions you can freely create your
		own group validators. This is part of the modular design of the GWT
		Validation Library that tries to help you to follow DRY (Don't repeat
		yourself) practices. So you would normally identify which kind of
		validations , transformators and actions you need and develop them
		once while using them throughout the application.
