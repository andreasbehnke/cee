	<h2>Server side validation</h2>
	<p>
		The GWT Validation Library makes it easy to do server side validation
		and automates the process of showing the validation errors "nicely" on
		the client side. That is for showing validation errors rooted on the
		server side the same functionality that is used for showing client
		side validation errors is used. That means if you bound for example a
		<tt class="interfacename">StyleAction</tt>
		to an
		<tt class="interfacename">Validator</tt>
		which was added to a TextBox that sets a red border when validation
		fails, that same functionality is accessed while processing validation
		errors from the server side, with a minimum amount of additional
		effort on the developers side.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the server side we have one special object which you will work
		with: The
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		It provides methods for doing your validation checks, so you can
		validate if the data sent by the client is correct. The main
		functionality that the
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		provides is the possibility to throw an
		<tt class="interfacename">ValidationException</tt>
		. This
		<tt>ValidationException</tt>
		can be understood by the client side code of the library and will
		result in the invocation of the actions added to the field that failed
		validation. So let's jump right into how you would do server side
		validation:
	</p>
	<br />
	<pre>
	public void saveCar(Car car) throws ValidationException {
	
		ServerValidation()
		.notNull(car, "car")
		.inRange(car.getPS(), 40, 230, "ps")
		.min(car.getSeats(), 2, "seats")
		.max(car.getDoors(), 5, "doors");
		
		
		//If we come here no validation errors, so invoke business logic
		
		carDao.save(car);
	
	} 
			</pre>
	<p>
		What we have here is a method of some service invoked via RCP. Note
		that it declares
		<tt class="interfacename">throws ValidationException</tt>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		We then use the
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		object to do some validations. Per default the
		<tt class="interfacename">ServerValidation</tt>
		will follow a "fail fast" approach (can be configured). That means the
		first validation constraint that is not met, will be send back to the
		client. So in this case the client would only see one validation
		failure even if there might have been more, because in the "fail fast"
		mode the first validation restriction that is not met will immediately
		trigger an
		<tt>ValidationException</tt>
		. This way we can safely assume that after the validation calls are
		over and there was no exception thrown, the validations went through
		successfully. If you would rather like to validate all the validations
		and only throw the
		<tt>ValidationException</tt>
		after all validations are validated you can do the following:
	</p>
	<pre>
	public void saveCar(Car car) throws ValidationException {
	
		ServerValidation(<font style="color: #f00;">false</font>)
		.notNull(car, "car")
		.inRange(car.getPS(), 40, 230, "ps")
		.min(car.getSeats(), 2, "seats")
		.max(car.getDoors(), 5, "doors")
		<font style="color: #f00;">.validate()</font>; //This will throw an <tt
			class="interfacename">ValidationException</tt> if there
				//were one or more errors
		
		
		//If we come here no validation errors, so invoke business logic
		
		carDao.save(car);
	
	} 
			</pre>
	<p>
		In this case all validations will be run and only at the end (at the
		call to <i>validate()</i>) a
		<tt class="interfacename">ValidationException</tt>
		might be thrown. This lets the client side part of the library be
		notified not only of the first validation that failed, like in the
		first example, it hands back ALL the errors to the client side that
		occured. This will in most cases probably be the better method to use
		the
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have validation needs that the
		<tt>ServerValidation</tt>
		does not provide (you will most likely have) than there is a easy way
		to still profit from the GWT Validation Libraries infrastructure. See
		this example:
	</p>
	<pre>
	public void createUser(User newUser) throws ValidationException {
	
		if(usernameTaken(newUser.getUsername())) {
			ServerValidation.exception("username_exists", "username");
		}
		
		userDao.create(newUser);
		
	}
			</pre>
	<p>
		The value of the first parameter is the message key which is given by
		you and can be fully i18n on the client side (see the <a
			href="?to=i18nDoc">section about i18n</a>). The second argument
		specifies the property that this validation error will be associated
		to on the client side.
	</p>

	<h2>Server side to client side validation</h2>
	<p>
		Lets look at a full example of validation that utilizes client side
		and server side validations. We assume we have a client side as shown
		in <a href="?to=clientDoc">client side validation chapter</a>. On the
		corresponding server side we want to store the entered year of birth.
		For exemplary reasons we also need this year to be unique. This unique
		check can only be done on the server side. So we could develop the
		server side something like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
	public void saveBirthYear(int birthYear) throws ValidationException {
		if(birthYearExists(birthYear)) {
			ServerValidation.exception("birth_year_exists", <font
			style="color: #f00;">"birthYear"</font>);
		}
		
		birthYearsDao.create(birthYear);
	}
			</pre>
	<p>
		The important part here is that the second parameter ("birthYear") to
		the
		<tt class="interfacename">ServerValidation.execption()</tt>
		method is called exactly the same like on the client side were we
		added a validator to the TextBox that contains the user input for the
		year of birth:
	</p>
	<pre>
	ValidationProcessor validator = new DefaultValidationProcessor();
	
	validator.addValidators( <font style="color: #f00;">"birthYear"</font>,
		new IntegerValidator(birthYearTextBox, 1890, 2009)
			.addActionForFailure(new StyleAction("validationFailedBorder"))
			.addActionForFailure(new LabelTextAction(errorLabel))
	);
			</pre>
	<p>
		The result is, that the user is provided with a validation message
		(through the
		<tt class="interfacename">LabelTextAction</tt>
		and a custom style (in this case the
		<tt class="interfacename">StyleAction</tt>
		) is added no matter if the error occured on the client side (through
		the
		<tt class="interfacename">IntegerValidator</tt>
		) or on the server side (through
		<tt>ServerValidation.exception()</tt>
		). So if you needed to change the visual appearence of validation
		errors you only need to change the client side code as the server side
		code just forwards to whatever you defined on the client side. You can
		take this approach even further by providing custom Validators that
		already come with the actions you seem fit pre-initialized, so you
		don't even have to add the actions over and over again. Because of
		this modularity it should be really time saving to build a rich visual
		user feedback.
